# bonsai-menu

Easily create lightweight, attractive restaurant menu sites.

Check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/andyxanthos/bonsai-menu/wiki/Get-Started) guide on the Wiki.

## To-do

Here is a list of things I am actively working on:

1. **Removing unused settings:** There are a few settings that I thought would be useful at the beginning of this project that have ended up being redundant, irrelevant, or replaced by defaults.

    *Update:* This is mostly done. 

2. **Theme support:** I would like for the user to be able to quickly change between themes by changing a single line in the `bonsai.json` file. Themes, in this case, are entire front-ends. (CSS, JS, View).

3. **CLI Tool:** I'm looking into writing a CLI tool that can reduce the time spent on at least some of the more tedious tasks (think adding a lot of menu items). The tool will also be able to create new projects, update your local version of the tool, and perform various administration tasks.

Once these things are done, I think `bonsai-menu` will be ready for public use.
